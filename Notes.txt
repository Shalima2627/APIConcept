API - Application Programming Interface, 
      We use API for to communicate from multiple sources or share the source from multiple sources.

* The API only provides data we want render in returned as json format(dict, key:value)

We use django models to store the database for datas and the datas are rendered with use of function
*Serializers is a structure for such models to return data as JSON format
In serializers are like when we create form,and for a model there should be a serializers

#In a POST Request:
When we recieve data from the request, We should confirm format of the data matches the serializers
